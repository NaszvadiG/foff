Friday off or foff is a simple opnionated leave management application. The interface is kept very simple and there are no calander controls at least 
when you're to apply for the leaves. You simply tell the way you will tell your HR manager about the leaves and that's done.

foff or Friday off comes from the fact that I like weekends if the Friday is off because it gives a longer weekend.
