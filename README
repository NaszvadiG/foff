foff (Friday Off) is an application that simply tracks your leaves. It is intentionally kept very simple. No calander controls!
Simpy select the type of leave and for how many days you need it in words as you would tell to any human being.

The name of the application lies in the fact that I am always excited if a Friday is off because it makes a long weekend.
